  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
  <p> I’m a User Experience (UX) Designer with a background in online marketing and teaching English as a Second Language. I have eight years of professional user-focused work experience in content writing, creativity, agile thinking, and customer service, plus training in multiple UX subjects.</p>
  <p> It’s always been a passion of mine to work in education and provide the opportunity for users to get the most out of their experience in the classroom. It’s taught me how to think on my feet - redesigning lesson plans on the go depending on the overall comprehension of the subject and being creative with presenting information. Currently, I work in program management where my focus is the customer and making sure they have the best experience with our company from start to finish.</p>
  <p> Now, I’m looking forward to applying that skill set - plus everything I have learned in my UX training - to researching and designing creative prototypes for products that have a positive impact on people’s lives and make the digital experience better for all users.</p>
  <p> UX Skills:
    Competitive Analysis, User Research, User Personas,Journey Maps, Information Architecture, Task Flows, Paper Prototyping, Wireframes, Prototypes, Usability Testing
    Balsamiq, Proto.io, Axure, InVision, Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator
